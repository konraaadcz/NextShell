# NextShell

NextShell is a PowerShell based terminal app for Windows designed to provide an efficient and "old-style" interface for interacting with your system via a terminal window. It includes multiple customizable features and is built with the ability to run shell commands, display logs, and support a multi-tab environment. The NextShell terminal application also includes features such as version checks, custom commands, and it's my biggest project ever ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
You can see all versions in the [Releases](https://github.com/konraaadcz/NextShell/releases) page
