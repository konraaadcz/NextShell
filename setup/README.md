# NextShell setup

I have collected the steps required to install the terminal.

# "The steps"

    1. Install the latest version in the [Releases](https://github.com/konraaadcz/NextShell/releases) page
    2. Unzip it and find a suitable location for the source code folder, e.g. "Program Files"
    3. Find the "setup" folder and inside it the "create-shortcut.bat" file
    4. Run the file, this will create a shortcut on the desktop
    5. Do not change the folder location afterwards.
